### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Shelby, a data focused senior software engineer. 

I'm currently working at [eSpark Learning](https://www.esparklearning.com/) helping students K-5 in reading and math. I work as a Senior Data Engineer on the Data & Infrastructure team using technologies ranging from AWS, dbt, Redshift, Postgres, Ruby on Rails, Python, and occasionally Terraform.

In my free time I like experimenting with new technologies, analyzing interesting data sets, and hacking away on some of my pet projects. Right now I'm interested in visualizing data with the Dash Plotly framework in Python. I'm also trying to get more proficient in R.

Ask me about new technologies I'm trying out, anything related to tennis, what I'm reading, my Golden Retriever, and projects I'm working on.

Send an email or message me on LinkedIn.
