### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Shelby Potts, a data focused backend software engineer. 

I'm currently working at [eSpark Learning](https://www.esparklearning.com/) helping students K-5 in reading and math. I work on the Data & Infrastructure team using technologies ranging from Ruby on Rails, AWS, dbt, Redshift, Postgres, Python, and occasionally Terraform.

In my free time I like experimenting with new technologies, analyzing interesting data sets, and hacking away on some of my pet projects. Right now I'm interested in web scraping and visualizing data with the Dash Plotly framework in Python. I'm also trying to get more proficient in R.

Ask me about new technologies I'm trying out, anything related to tennis, what I'm reading, my Golden Retriever, and projects I'm working on.

Send an email or message me on LinkedIn.
