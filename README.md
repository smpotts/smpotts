### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Shelby, and I like data. 

I'm currently working at [eSpark Learning](https://www.esparklearning.com/) using AI to help students K-5 in reading and math. I work as a Senior Software Engineer on the Data & Infrastructure team using technologies ranging from AWS, dbt, Redshift, Postgres, Ruby on Rails, Python, MySQL and occasionally Terraform.

In my free time I like experimenting with new technologies, analyzing interesting data sets, and hacking away on some of my pet projects. I'm currently reading [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) by Robert Martin and [How To Lie With Statistics](https://www.amazon.com/How-Lie-Statistics-Darrell-Huff/dp/0393310728) by Darrell Huff. Right now I'm also interested in visualizing data with the Dash Plotly framework in Python.  

In my copious free time I'm working my way through my [Chicago Bucket List](chicago_bucket_list.md). Ask me about things I've checked off the list recently, projects I'm working on, anything related to tennis, what I'm reading, and my Golden Retriever.
