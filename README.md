### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Shelby, and I like data. 

I'm currently working at [eSpark Learning](https://www.esparklearning.com/) using AI to help students K-5 in reading and math. I work as a Senior Software Engineer on the Data & Infrastructure team using technologies ranging from AWS, dbt, Redshift, Postgres, Ruby on Rails, Python, MySQL and occasionally Terraform.

In my free time I like experimenting with new technologies, analyzing interesting data sets, and hacking away on some of my pet projects. I'm currently reading [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) by Robert Martin and [Storytelling with Data](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119002257/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1) by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic. I'm also working on my Masters in Data Science.  

In my copious personal time I'm working my way through my [Chicago Bucket List](chicago_bucket_list.md) and [Chicago Tennis List](chicago_tennis_list.md). Ask me about things I've checked off the list recently, projects I'm working on, anything related to tennis, what I'm reading, and my Golden Retriever.
