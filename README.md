### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Shelby, and I like data. 

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer working at [eSpark Learning](https://www.esparklearning.com/) using AI to help students K-5 in reading and math. I work as a Senior Software Engineer on the Data & Infrastructure team using technologies ranging from AWS, dbt, Redshift, Postgres, Ruby on Rails, Python, and occasionally Terraform.

In my free time I like experimenting with new technologies, analyzing interesting data sets, and hacking away on some of my pet projects. I'm currently reading [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) by Robert Martin and [How To Lie With Statistics](https://www.amazon.com/How-Lie-Statistics-Darrell-Huff/dp/0393310728) by Darrell Huff. Right now I'm also interested in visualizing data with the Dash Plotly framework in Python.  

Ask me about new technologies I'm trying out, anything related to tennis, what I'm reading, my Golden Retriever, and projects I'm working on.

Send an email or message me on LinkedIn.
